# UCB CS61A 2022 Summer

> Computer Science is about '3A': Abstraction, Algorithm, Automation.

Projects, Labs, HWs, Discs and Notes about CS61A.
This is an awesome class that everyone should take.

Topics that refreshes myself are:

- Environment Diagram and PythonTutor: that's how you should think of programming
- Recursive: This time not Fibbnacci sequence, quite boring. Understanding of Recursion can be 3 level:
    1. Manipulate Linked List, Tree, and Graph
    2. Substitute Repeat control in a language with no such things, like `Scheme`, `Lisp`.
    3. Frame (or stack in OS) is the deepest reason, and that's why `Tail Calls` are important in `Scheme`
- Higher Order Functions: abstraction of procedure.
- Declarative Programming: if you have ever use Google's `Jax` instead of `Tensorflow` or `Pytorch` to train neural network, then you know why declarative programming is important.
